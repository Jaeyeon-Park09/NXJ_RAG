It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You\n\ncan use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nTo discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the\n\ntitle page.\n\n<!-- PAGE_65 -->\n###### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to pharmaceutical companies interested in\n\nparticipating in a program involving the submission of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls\n\n(CMC) information containing emerging technology† to FDA. The program is open to\n\ncompanies that intend to include the technology as part of a regulatory submission including\n\ninvestigational new drug applications (IND), original or supplemental new drug applications\n\n(NDA), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) or biologic license applications (BLA), or\n\napplication-associated Drug Master Files (DMF)‡ reviewed by the Center for Drug\n\nEvaluation and Research (CDER), and where that technology meets other criteria described\n\nin this guidance.\n\nThis program does not cover products reviewed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and\n\nResearch.\n\nIssues in pharmaceutical manufacturing have the potential to significantly impact patient\n\n* This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality in the Center for Drug Evaluation and\n\nResearch at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n†  For the purpose of this document, emerging technology should be novel in the context of the pharmaceutical and\n\nrelated industries and it should have the potential to modernize the pharmaceutical manufacturing body of\n\nknowledge related to product quality. Emerging technology will be new to FDA in the context of pharmaceutical\n\nquality, with limited prior experience and knowledge.\n\n‡ 3 This program is also open to companies or manufacturers that intend to include emerging technology in a drug\n\nmaster file (DMF) that will be referenced by the planned application(s). The steps to request participation in the\n\nprogram are described in section III.B Process.\n\n- - 61 -\ncare as failures in quality may result in product recalls and harm to patients. Additionally,\n\nproduct failures or facility, equipment, or manufacturing problems are a major factor leading\n\nto disruptions in drug supply. Modernizing manufacturing technology* may lead to a more\n\nrobust manufacturing process with fewer interruptions in production, fewer product failures\n\n(before or after distribution), and greater assurance that the drug products manufactured in\n\nany given period of time will provide the expected clinical performance. For example,\n\ncontemporary aseptic manufacturing facilities that are highly automated and use isolators\n\nand other modern separation technologies have the potential to decrease the risk of\n\ncontamination from the processing line. Encouraging development of emerging technology\n\nmay lead to pharmaceutical innovation and modernization, such as a more robust drug\n\nproduct design and improved manufacturing with better process control, thereby leading to\n\nimproved product quality and availability throughout a product’s lifecycle.\n\nIn this program, pharmaceutical companies can, prior to the regulatory submission, submit\n\nquestions and proposals about the use of specific emerging technology to a group within\n\nFDA (Emerging Technology Team – ETT), which includes relevant representation from all\n\nFDA pharmaceutical quality functions. The ETT works in partnership with relevant\n\npharmaceutical quality offices and assumes a leadership or co-leadership role for the\n\ncross-functional quality assessment team (including review and on-site facility evaluation or\n\ninspection) for submissions involving emerging technology. The ETT serves as the primary\n\npoint of contact for companies that are interested in implementing emerging technology in\n\nthe manufacture of their drug products and for the relevant quality assessment team to:\n\n(b) Identify and help facilitate regulatory assessment of an emerging technology in\n\naccordance with existing legal and regulatory standards, guidance, and Agency policy\n\nrelated to quality assessment;\n\n(c) Serve as the lead or co-lead on the quality assessment team (i.e., staff involved\n\nin the review of the CMC sections of the application and evaluation of the\n\nmanufacturing facilities), in partnership with relevant pharmaceutical quality offices,\n\n* For the purpose of this guidance, the definition of manufacturing includes testing, packaging and labeling\n\noperations, and quality control across the product lifecycle (e.g., design, qualification, and commercial\n\nmanufacturing). Refer to 21 CFR 210.3(b)(12).\n\n- - 62 -\nincluding the Office of Compliance and Office of Regulatory Affairs, as appropriate,\n\nto conduct review, on-site evaluation, and make the final quality recommendation\n\nregarding the potential approval of submissions in the program; and (d) Identify and\n\nresolve policy issues to inform FDA approaches and recommendations regarding\n\nfuture submissions that involve the same technology.\n\nIn general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed\n\nonly as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The\n\nuse of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or\n\nrecommended, but not required.\n\n<!-- PAGE_67 -->\n###### II. BACKGROUND\n\nFDA is committed to supporting and enabling pharmaceutical innovation and modernization as\n\npart of the Agency’s mission to protect and promote the public health. The Agency hopes\n\nthat  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations these efforts may also help reduce the number\n\nof drug shortages, as noted in FDA’s drug shortage strategic plan.* In 2002, FDA launched\n\nan initiative entitled “Pharmaceutical cGMPs for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach,”\n\nto encourage the implementation of a modern, risk-based pharmaceutical quality assessment\n\nsystem.† One of the goals of this initiative was to encourage the early adoption of new\n\ntechnological advances by the pharmaceutical industry and ensure that regulatory review,\n\ncompliance, and inspection policies are based on state-of-the-art pharmaceutical science. In\n\n2004, this was further described in the FDA guidance for industry entitled PAT—A Framework\n\nfor Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance.‡ This\n\nguidance describes a scientific, risk-based framework intended to support innovation and\n\nefficiency in pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and quality assurance. The guidance\n\nalso describes the concept that quality cannot be tested into products; in other words, it\n\n* 5 See FDA’s Strategic Plan for Preventing and Mitigating Drug Shortages at:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/UCM372566.pdf\n\n† See Pharmaceutical cGMP’s for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach at:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/manufacturing/questionsandanswersoncurrentg\n\noodmanufacturingpracticescgmpfordrugs/ucm176374.pdf\n\n‡ We update guidances periodically.

Quality is built into pharmaceutical products\n\nthrough a comprehensive understanding of the intended use of the product, the characteristics\n\nof the product, and the design of the product and manufacturing process using principles of\n\nengineering, material science, and quality assurance to ensure acceptable and reproducible\n\nproduct quality and performance throughout a product’s lifecycle.\n\nFDA continues to support flexible approaches in the manufacturing of quality pharmaceutical\n\nproducts. While the implementation of emerging technology is critical to advancing product\n\ndesign, modernizing pharmaceutical manufacturing, and improving quality, FDA also recognizes\n\nthat the adoption of innovative approaches may represent challenges to industry and the\n\nAgency. By the very nature of an approach being innovative, a limited knowledge and\n\nexperiential base about the technology may exist. Pharmaceutical companies may have\n\nconcerns that using such technologies could result in delays while FDA reviewers familiarize\n\nthemselves with the new technologies and determine how they fit within existing regulatory\n\nframework. Through the Emerging Technology Program, FDA intends to encourage the\n\nadoption of innovative approaches to product design and pharmaceutical manufacturing by\n\nleveraging existing resources within the Agency to facilitate the regulatory assessment of\n\nsubmissions to the Agency involving novel technologies likely to improve product quality and\n\navailability throughout a product’s lifecycle.\n\n<!-- PAGE_68 -->\n###### III. DISCUSSION\n\nAs part of this program, FDA intends to provide early engagement and additional meeting\n\nopportunities, which enable the participants and FDA to discuss: (1) product or manufacturing\n\ndesign and development issues, and (2) submission content related to the emerging technology.\n\nThe process will include appropriate coordination with the FDA quality assessment team. Based\n\non experience gained during the program, FDA intends to develop guidance and standards, as\n\nnecessary, on emerging technologies and approaches to encourage and facilitate the innovation\n\nand modernization in pharmaceutical industry.\n\nA. Scope\n\nAcceptance of a request to participate in this program will depend on the applicant’s\n\nproposed plan for submission of an IND, original or supplemental ANDA, BLA, or NDA, or\n\n- - 64 -\napplicationassociated DMF based on the criteria described below.\n\n- • The planned submission should include one or more elements which will be subject to\nquality assessment for which the Agency has limited review or inspection experience.\n\nExamples of such elements include an innovative or novel: (1) product technology (e.g.,\n\ndosage form or container-closure system); (2) manufacturing process (e.g., design,\n\nscale-up, or lifecycle approaches); and/or (3) control strategy (e.g., testing technology or\n\n- • The proposed technology in the planned submission has the potential to improve\nproduct safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity (e.g., an innovative process design\n\nthat can lead to a more robust and predictable production of quality pharmaceutical\n\nIn the request to the Agency, the applicant should provide sufficient justification that the\n\nproposed emerging technology in the planned submission meets the above criteria (see section\n\nIII.B Process for details regarding steps to request participation in the program). Such an\n\napproach, rather than providing a prescriptive set of acceptance criteria, enables the program\n\nto be open to a wide variety of novel manufacturing technologies. As a reminder, this\n\nprogram only affects the quality section of the submission (CMC and facility-related\n\ninformation). Existing requirements related to the review and determination of adequacy or\n\napproval of a submission will not be waived, suspended, or modified for purposes of this\n\nprogram. Applicants must make the submission in accordance with 21 CFR parts 312, 314, 601,\n\nand other applicable standards.\n\nParties planning to submit an IND, original or supplemental BLA or NDA, or\n\napplicationassociated DMF, and who have an interest in participating in this FDA program\n\nshould submit a written request for a Type C meeting as described in the FDA guidance for\n\nindustry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicant. The request should\n\nspecify the meeting request as a “Type C meeting – request to participate in the Emerging\n\nTechnology Program.”Interested parties planning to submit an ANDA should submit a\n\npre-ANDA meeting request and specify the meeting request as a “Pre-ANDA meeting –\n\nrequest to participate in the Emerging Technology Program.” Either type of request should\n\nbe submitted at least three months prior to the planned application submission date. The\n\n- - 65 -\nmeeting\n\nrequest\n\nand\n\nrelated\n\nquestions\n\nshould\n\nbe\n\nsubmitted\n\nelectronically\n\nto\n\nCDER-ETT@fda.hhs.gov.* In addition to the items outlined in the referenced guidance, the\n\nrequest should also include the following items and should not exceed five pages including\n\nfigures and tables:\n\nBased on the availability of Agency resources, we expect to limit acceptance into the program\n\nto technologies that are likely to advance product design or modernize pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturing, and with which the Agency has limited prior experience and knowledge. FDA\n\nexpects to notify companies of its decision regarding acceptance into the program in writing\n\nwithin 60 days of receipt of the request. Although incomplete and/or unclear requests will\n\ngenerally be denied, FDA may contact the applicant to request additional information. Once\n\naccepted into the program, the participant can engage with the ETT and quality assessment\n\nteam in accordance with existing meeting procedures and guidance(s).†\n\n* If the request includes commercial confidential information, it is the responsibility of the company to ensure it is\n\none of FDA’s secure messaging partners. Companies may request to be added to the list of FDA’s secure messaging\n\npartners by sending a request to: SecureEmail@fda.hhs.gov.\n\n† See the FDA guidances for industry on Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants (see\n\ninformation on “Type C” meetings) and Controlled Correspondence Related to Generic Drug Development.\n\n- - 66 -\n<!-- PAGE_71 -->\n###### <부록 2>\n\n<!-- PAGE_71 -->\n###### PMDA Views on Applying Continuous Manufacturing\n\n<!-- PAGE_71 -->\n###### to Pharmaceutical Products for Industry (provisional draft)\n\nMarch 30, 2018\n\nPharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency\n\nInnovative Manufacturing Technology Working Group\n\n<!-- PAGE_71 -->\n###### Introduction\n\nContinuous Manufacturing is a manufacturing method in which raw materials or their blended\n\nmaterials are entered continuously in the manufacturing process throughout the duration of\n\nthe process, and products are produced continuously through the manufacturing. Quality\n\ncontrol procedures (control strategies) that are appropriately established based on the scientific\n\ndata/knowledge ensure that product made by a continuous manufacturing process is\n\nhomogenous and of desired quality. Continuous Manufacturing can be used in various cases:\n\nWhere all the stages of processing are continuous, from charging raw materials to discharging\n\nfinal products; and where only certain stages of the manufacturing process are continuous.\n\nTherefore, the control strategy employed should consider how the Continuous Manufacturing\n\nprocess is designed and product characteristics.\n\nIt is feasible that Continuous Manufacturing makes it possible to manufacture a desired amount\n\nof products with appropriate quality attributes at a desired timing. With its continuous process\n\noperation, Continuous Manufacturing will be expected to maintain production efficiency\n\nirrespective of the equipment scale.\n\nBy adjusting such as the continuous operating time in the process, Continuous Manufacturing\n\ncan cater for a wide range of batch size. This can allow for the same manufacturing\n\nequipment to be used from the developmental phase to the commercial phase, contributing to\n\nnot only consistent quality production but also labor-saving for scale-up studies and robust\n\ntechnology transfer. Therefore, Continuous Manufacturing is considered an efficient\n\nmanufacturing technology. In\n\naddition, Continuous Manufacturing can be a useful production technology for pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturers that require multi-product and low-volume production.\n\nIn July 2016, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) established the\n\n- - 67 -\nInnovative Manufacturing Technology Working Group (IMT-WG) as part of the Projects Across\n\nMulti-Offices in PMDA. The IMT-WG launched activities to examine desirable regulations that\n\nstreamline the introduction of new manufacturing technologies, and selected Continuous\n\nManufacturing as our primary target. This document includes some views on applying\n\nContinuous Manufacturing to pharmaceutical products at this time point, which are compiled\n\nwithin the limited practical experience that the IMTWG has. The contents of this document\n\nshould be reviewed according to the future experience and accumulated knowledge. Therefore,\n\nit is submitted as a provisional draft. This provisional draft was prepared by anticipating the\n\nfollowing cases, (1) through (2).\n\n- (1) It is intended for solid oral dosage forms (tablets, etc.) manufactured using drug\n- (2) An ideal production state is achieved. For example, manufacturing equipment is filled\nIn addition, this document does not cover matters for GMP controls.\n\nActual application of Continuous Manufacturing to individual products may require the control\n\nof their quality attributes and manufacturing processes, as well as the considerations according\n\nto the level of knowledge and understanding of these quality attributes and manufacturing\n\nprocesses. Therefore, the utilization of the PMDA's face-to-face consultation services with the\n\nPMDA review division is advised.\n\n<!-- PAGE_72 -->\n###### I. Control Strategy for Continuous Manufacturing\n\nA control strategy is defined in “Pharmaceutical Quality System” (Pharmaceutical and Food\n\nSafety Bureau [PFSB]/Evaluation and Licensing Division [ELD] Notification No. 0219-1 and\n\nPFSB/Compliance and Narcotics Division [CND] Notification No. 0219-1 dated February 19,\n\n2010) (ICH Q10) as follows: “A planned set of controls, derived from current product and\n\nprocess understanding, that assures process performance and product quality. The controls can\n\ninclude parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and\n\ncomponents, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product\n\nspecifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control.” Details\n\nof control strategy are explained in Part II Annex of “Pharmaceutical Development”\n\n(PFSB/ELD Notification No. 0628-1 dated June 28, 2010) (ICH Q8 [R2]).\n\n- - 68 -\nFor establishing a control strategy for commercial production during the developmental phase\n\nof pharmaceutical products, there is no fundamental difference between the Batch\n\nManufacturing and Continuous Manufacturing in terms of factors to ensure Critical Quality\n\nAttributes (CQA) of the final products, such as quality attributes of the raw materials and\n\nintermediate products, specifications of the products, process parameters, and in-process\n\ncontrols (except for process dynamics which is mentioned below). Therefore, in order to\n\nunderstand the relationship between the factors to be controlled and the CQA, it is useful to\n\nacquire knowledge of process parameters and in-process controls that can be obtained during\n\nthe process of establishing the control strategy in accordance with ICH Q8 [R2]. Additionally, it\n\nis necessary to take into consideration the specific factors that have not been anticipated\n\nduring Batch Manufacturing, through the qualification of equipment or devices to be used in\n\nContinuous Manufacturing, regarding their characteristic factors. It is also necessary to consider\n\nthat multiple factors that need to be controlled should be linked to a CQA not only by\n\nhandling these factors according to the unit process but also by handling them through the\n\nentire manufacturing process.\n\n- 1. Beneficial control strategy for Continuous Manufacturing\nIn Continuous Manufacturing, the process inputs, i.e. material attributes of raw materials\n\ncould change along with the progression of the Continuous Manufacturing process, which may\n\nimpact the quality of the product or intermediate product. Therefore, more flexible handling\n\ncould be required compared to the traditional Batch Manufacturing, such as the adjustment of\n\nprocess parameters according to the changes in the material attributes. For this reason, it is\n\nimportant to understand the relationship between process inputs and CQAs, and the knowledge\n\nfrom existing control strategies used for Batch Manufacturing, linked with process parameters,\n\nare also considered beneficial for Continuous Manufacturing in the case of switching the\n\nmanufacturing method. The control strategy that has been used for traditional Batch\n\nManufacturing ensures the quality attributes of the intermediate products obtained in the\n\nprocess by establishing a Proven Acceptable Range (PAR) of the process parameters or a\n\nDesign Space. This control strategy that uses the process parameters, not in-process testing,\n\ncan also be used for the Continuous Manufacturing by performing the qualification of\n\nequipment or devices including their attribute factors on an asneeded and also providing\n\ncorrelation between process parameters and critical quality attributes of intermediates and final\n\nproducts. Rather, in the case of Continuous Manufacturing, where the same manufacturing\n\nequipment can be used from the developmental phase to the commercial production, the\n\ncontrol strategy with the process parameters established in the developmental phase can be\n\n- - 69 -\napplied easier than the Batch Manufacturing, which requires scale-up for commercial\n\nproduction.\n\nIt is also possible to employ a control strategy that ensures the product quality with the\n\nconstant monitoring of targeted quality attribute of the materials such as intermediate\n\nproducts, by using Process Analytical Technology (PAT), including but not limit to\n\nNear-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) or other technics. This control method may be useful for\n\nachieving a reduction in end product testing by controlling the range of quality attributes\n\nduring the monitoring in the relevant\n\nprocess. Moreover, this method will be helpful to ensure the consistency of the product quality\n\nattribute during the process if it is possible to establish the Action Limit within the proven\n\nacceptable range and maintain the process to the required condition by controlling changes\n\nduring processing using feedback or feedforward control (Performance-based Approach). The\n\nabove-mentioned control method may be more useful for Continuous Manufacturing than Batch\n\nManufacturing since Continuous Manufacturing may require the adjustment of process\n\nparameters in real time in order to maintain product CQAs within the proven acceptable\n\nranges. When developing a control strategy for Continuous Manufacturing, it is important to\n\nemploy controls according to the impact on the quality of products (Fit for Purpose), by\n\nutilizing the knowledge obtained during the developmental phase as well as the result of risk\n\nassessment, and applying specific considerations for the control strategy for Continuous\n\nManufacturing presented below.\n\n- 2. Specific considerations for control strategy for Continuous Manufacturing –Understanding of\nprocess dynamics-\n\nIn Continuous Manufacturing, raw materials and their blended materials continuously enter the\n\nmanufacturing process and the products are discharged on a continuous basis; therefore, due\n\nto any variations that occur during processing, products that do not meet the desired quality\n\nmay be produced for a period of time if appropriate manufacturing controls are not in place.\n\nIn order to ensure that the products meet the desired quality consistently throughout the\n\noperation time, as in the case of Batch Manufacturing, manufacturers should ensure control\n\nfor each unit operation (e.g.blending, granulating, tableting) that comprises the manufacturing\n\nprocess, and understand the process dynamics within unit operations (e.g. in the granulation\n\nprocess) or between unit operations\n\n(e.g. between the blending process and the granulation process). Understanding of pro is\n\nmaintained. Monitoring the quality attributes of materials during processing using a PAT tool\n\n(including soft sensors possibly) is useful as one of the combined control methods to ensure a\n\n- - 70 -\n“State of Control.” Even without utilize a spectroscopic PAT tool, it would be possible to\n\nensure a “State of Control” if the process dynamics can be obtained by simulating the\n\nmanufacturing process for example using a Residence Time Distribution (RTD) model to\n\nestimate blend concentration in the manufacturing line in conjunction with monitoring observed\n\nprocess parameters.\n\nAs mentioned above, the control strategy needs to be evaluated individually. Therefore PMDA\n\nrecommends establishing an early dialogue with regulators during the development stage of\n\nContinuous Manufacturing.\n\n<!-- PAGE_75 -->\n###### II. Batch Definition in Continuous Manufacturing\n\nThere is no difference in the definition of “Batch” between Batch Manufacturing and\n\nContinuous Manufacturing. However, the concept of batch size is different.\n\nThe definition of Batch (or Lot) is provided in “Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for\n\n“A specific quantity of material produced in a process or series of processes so that it is\n\nexpected to be homogeneous within specified limits. In the case of continuous production, a\n\nbatch may correspond to a defined fraction of the production. The batch size can be\n\nThe batch (or lot) size in Continuous Manufacturing can be specified based on any of the\n\nfollowing aspects:\n\n- (1) The run time and the processing speed\n- (2) The volume of material produced\n- (3) The feed amount of raw materials\nIn Continuous Manufacturing, parameters can be modified within a validated range. These\n\nparameters include run time, processing speed, volume of material produced, etc. The\n\nuniformity of a batch can be ensured by maintaining a “State of Control” through the\n\n- - 71 -\ncontrol based on mathematical models and/or the continuous monitoring with PAT, etc.\n\n<!-- PAGE_76 -->\n###### III. Validation for Continuous Manufacturing\n\nAs is the case in Batch Manufacturing, validation for Continuous Manufacturing needs to be\n\nimplemented in accordance with the validation standards. For Continuous Manufacturing, it is\n\nimportant to validate the following:\n\n- (1) Process performance and quality attributes during Continuous Manufacturing are\n- (2) Based on the dynamics of how raw materials or intermediates flow through the\nprocess, chronological changes in quality between batches as well as within a batch\n\nBasically, as in the Batch Manufacturing, process validation needs to be performed using\n\nthe production batch size at the production scale, repeated with at least 3 batches or\n\nperformed with an equivalent method to ensure the repeatability. In case of being\n\nscientifically guaranteed that there are no chronological changes in quality, it may be\n\npossible to carry out in 3 batches or more in total including the batch produced with the\n\nprocessing speed or the manufacturing time is changed according to the commercial\n\nmanufacturing scale in addition to the batch produced at the maximum expected actual\n\nproduction scale. Furthermore validation design that introduces the idea of continuous\n\nThe batch size of a product to which Continuous Manufacturing is applied should be\n\nestablished before being manufactured by the manufacturer based on the feed amount of\n\nraw materials as in the Batch Manufacturing, desired amount of production volume or the\n\nrun time at a certain processing speed. In Continuous Manufacturing, the batch size should\n\nbe established by taking into consideration the operability of manufacturing equipment in a\n\nlonger operation time and the effects of accumulated substances on manufacturing\n\nequipment. Therefore, when manufacturing is performed using an expected range of batch\n\nsizes, process validation needs to be performed with the production batch size that can\n\nensure stable performance of the manufacturing process and the product quality during the\n\noperating time. This process validation should be repeated with at least 3 batches or\n\n- - 72 -\nperformed with an equivalent or superior method.\n\nAdditionally, in Continuous Manufacturing, the same equipment or conditions that were\n\nused in the developmental stage may be used in commercial production. In such cases, the\n\nknowledge acquired in the developmental phase can be used as the data to support\n\ncommercial production.\n\n- 2. Validation on changes for an approved product in switching from the Batch\nManufacturing to Continuous Manufacturing Basically, this will be handled in the same\n\n<!-- PAGE_77 -->\n###### IV. Stability Testing for Continuous Manufacturing\n\nIn Continuous Manufacturing, the batch size can be varied by changing the operating time\n\nof the manufacturing process within the validated range. Therefore, unlike Batch\n\nManufacturing, in the case of Continuous Manufacturing, it is especially important to ensure\n\nthat products are being manufactured with the equivalent quality regardless of any time\n\nmanufacturing process. For this reason, it is required to ensure a “State of Control,”\n\nscientifically proving that chronological changes are within an acceptable range in quality\n\ndue to transient disturbances or failures in equipment performance. Upon assuring this, it is\n\npossible to judge that, in Continuous Manufacturing, batches of any batch size are\n\nsufficiently representing the manufacturing methods and processes that are to be applied to\n\nthe commercial production, and that variation in the batch size will not necessarily pose a\n\nmajor risk to stability of products. With Continuous Manufacturing, a batch that is\n\nmanufactured with any batch size can be the primary batch. In this case, as is the case\n\nwith the traditional Batch Manufacturing, it is necessary to understand the potential risks\n\narising from the variation in the batch size by risk assessment, etc., and to explain that the\n\nprimary batch has the same characteristics as other batches manufactured at the established\n\nmaximum batch size.\n\n- 2. Number of primary batches\nEven in Continuous Manufacturing, the basic idea for the number of primary batches\n\nneeded is the same as that in Batch Manufacturing. Basically, at least three batches are\n\n- - 73 -\nrequired according to “Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products” (PFSB/ELD\n\nNotification No. 0603001 dated June 3, 2003) (ICH Q1A [R2]). In addition, for Continuous\n\nManufacturing, it is necessary to record information on the sampling points (spot, time etc.)\n\nused for the primary batch, as the batch size of the primary batch itself may vary.\n\n<!-- PAGE_78 -->\n###### V. Glossary\n\nCritical Quality Attribute (CQA): A physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or\n\ncharacteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the\n\ndesired product quality (ICH Q8 [R2])\n\nProven Acceptable Range (PAR): A characterized range of a process parameter for which\n\noperation within this range, while keeping other parameters constant, will result in producing a\n\nmaterial meeting relevant quality criteria. (ICH Q8 [R2])\n\nProcess Analytical Technology (PAT): A system for designing, analyzing, and controlling\n\nmanufacturing through timely measurements (i.e., during processing) of critical quality and\n\nperformance attributes of raw and intermediate products/in-process materials and processes\n\nwith the goal of ensuring final product quality. (ICH Q8 [R2])\n\nAction Limit: A reference value established through the integrated considerations for\n\ntechnology and desired product quality within the manufacturing process and the range of\n\nproduct quality specifications. When the production system is in operation, if any monitor data\n\nthat exceed the established action limits are obtained, it indicates that the manufacturing\n\nprocess has deviated from the control range. In this case, the operation manager of the\n\nproduction system must take corrective action to bring the process back within its normal\n\noperating range. Exceeding an action limit does not necessarily indicate that the product\n\nquality has been compromised. Note)\n\nProcess Dynamics: Traceability of the input materials based on the residence time distribution\n\nand effects of expected changes on the quality of the downstream products Note)\n\nState of Control: A condition in which the set of controls consistently provides assurance of\n\ncontinued process performance and product quality (ICH Q10) Note)\n\nPerformance-based Approach: Differing from the process control using fixed process\n\n- - 74 -\nparameters, the control method that can achieve the desired product quality by adjusting\n\nprocess parameters as per the control strategy according to any changes that occur during\n\nprocessing based on measuring and assessing quality of the final or intermediate products in\n\nreal time using PAT, etc. Note)\n\nFit for Purpose: A risk based weighting of the control strategy based on potential impact on\n\nproduct quality. Note)\n\nPrimary batch: A batch of a drug substance or drug product used in a formal stability study,\n\nfrom which stability data are submitted in a registration application for the purpose of\n\nestablishing a retest period or shelf life, respectively. A primary batch of a drug substance\n\nshould be at least a pilot\n\nscale batch. For a drug product, two of the three batches should be at least a pilot scale\n\nbatch, and the third batch can be smaller if it is representative with regard to the critical\n\nmanufacturing steps.\n\nHowever, a primary batch may be a production batch.
